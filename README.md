I am building a statistics website for the best strategic board game [Terraforming Mars](https://www.fryxgames.se/games/terraforming-mars/)! Having played *a lot* of games, me and my friends collected bunch of data. Thus I have decided to create this website to analyise our scores and simplify game logging. 

I am using Django and Postgresql alongside with rest framework for building the Web API. The app can be easily deployed using Docker.
